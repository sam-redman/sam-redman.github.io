I passed the CISSP exam 01/05/2025 after three months of daily study. The CISSP is geared towards people who have five years of cyber security experience and are looking for validation to back up their work experience. This is why I took the exam. I’ve got the experience, let’s solidify it.

You can take the exam without the experience, but then you will only be a CISSP Associate, which doesn’t hold as much weight. But you can then get the full CISSP retrospectively once you have the experience. If you are one year off the five years experience, then it probably does make sense to take the exam. However, if you are going into this exam thinking that it’s going to make you into a cyber security whizz, you will be disappointed. It really is a knowledge and experience check - you’re not breaking new ground, you’re proving yourself. That’s how you should see it, and if that’s you, you should do look at sitting the exam.

## Study Plan

My study for the exam was done over three months. You don’t necessarily have to do the same but I think that three months is a pretty safe bet. That is to say, if you study for three months consistently there is no reason you won’t pass the exam. Obviously, this depends on your work experience, and experience with other certifications. I definitely would not study for less than two months.

When studying, consistency is key. So your goal should be to do the same thing everyday with few exceptions. So to begin with you need to pick a period of time where you don’t have any holidays or other life events coming up for two to three months. Over the study period I would not recommend more than a “day off” per month - which is to say, days that you do no study. That is probably quite controversial but knowledge rotation is all about little and often. And if you get in to the habit of skipping a day here and there, you’ll just stop in your tracks and you’ll have wasted your time up to that point.

You might be wondering, how much time a day should I dedicate to studying? Well, at least an hour, but ideally two, and as you get closer to the exam (last month) you’ll want to up it to three. Now what does studying look like? Well it looks like this everyday:

### Month 1

- **Udemy course progression:** Just watching paying attention, don’t write notes.
- **LearnZApp questions:** 10 to 30 a day, these do become less useful the closer you get to the exam but at the start of your study they really help drill in the technical concepts.
- **Official Study Guide book/audiobook:** If you’re reading the book then you’ll need to dedicate time to reading it. However, it’s super dry and not that interesting so you may find that to be a challenge. I preferred the audiobook and I would listen to it everyday on my daily walk for about an hour each day.

### Month 2

All of the above but now including:

- **YouTube:** Exam Cram, Mind Map & How To Think Like A Manager videos.

### Month 3

All of the above (minus the courses if complete) but now including:

- **Practice exams:** Dion Training practice exams are more than enough here. You can find other providers if you wish. I have heard Quantum Exams have a good exam simulator but I can’t attest to that.

### Study Tips

Try not to repeat resources, so for example, don’t listen to the same course twice unless you really didn’t pay attention the first time. Absorb the material and move on. In saying that, try to space out the content throughout the weeks and aim to have the Udemy courses completed by the start of the third month. Month number three is where you have gained all the knowledge but now you need to apply it. Stick to the plan or a plan and do it everyday and you will succeed.

## When To Book The Exam

You will never feel ready to sit the exam - it’s just not that kind of certification. I would recommend that once you start studying, you just book the exam for three months time. Set a date, put it in your calendar and works towards it. Don’t wait until you feel ready, because you won’t ever feel that way. Just do it. Doing this will help you mentally as it makes it harder for you to give in and quit because the date is set and you’re actively working towards it.

## How To Study

Here are some simple concepts that if you implement will create real learning moments rather than what most people would consider to be “studying” which is 90% them looking at their phone or being distracted:

- Put your phone to the side and if you pick it up during your study time, then that doesn’t count towards your dedicated study time. So if you study in the evening and you pick your phone up for 20 minutes in your study time, well you’re going to have to stay up another 20 minutes to make up the study time. This does require a significant amount of discipline and will power but it is effective.
- Listen to music while studying, but not with lyrics. You don’t want to use the part of your brain that interprets language on the music you’re listening to while studying. You want to be fully engaged at the things you are reading and seeing on your screen. Music with no lyrics will keep you motivated and calm and you’ll actually find yourself working to the music, but just make sure there are no lyrics. You can find plenty of study playlists on Spotify for example.
- Dedicate time to studying each day. Block out the hours you need to study for each day and do it the same time everyday. Obviously, from time to time this is not possible but try not to make it a habit.
- Watching > Listening > Reading - this is the priority when it comes to absorbing learning materials but your mileage may vary.

## Exam Strategy

- Eliminate answers that are the least correct. You want to make every question you look at a 50/50 pretty much and go from there. When studying make sure you do this, read the question and then eliminate two answers. Go from there.
- Try to think from a higher-level. It’s kind of the in the same vein as “think like a manager” but don’t take this too literally. I’ve read a lot of complaints about the exam that you need to apply this to every question. It’s not really true. The better approach, is to just think from a higher level. You’re not too concerned with the nitty gritty - just high level thinking.
- Read the questions many times. If it takes you five times to understand the question then read it five times. Try to understand exactly what you’re being asked. This is true for all exams, but it’s amazing how often people will read the question once, think they know what it’s asking and then pick the completely wrong answer.

## Final Nuggets Of Information

- Focus on getting technical knowledge down so it can then be applied contextually for the exam.
- Practice questions will only get you so far - nothing is quite like the real exam questions and that's by design. It's an applied knowledge test.
- r/CISSP can be a good place to find resources but don’t look here everyday because it’s filled with a lot of people bragging about passing or failing (whilst claiming to have studied for 6 months).
