Another day, another CTF event. N0PSctf 2025 is a super unique and quite niche CTF that I had not heard of until it randomly popped up on CTFtime, and I figured that I may as well give it a go since CTFs have been a bit dry and far and few between recently. N0PSctf was a 36 hour event which made it rather tight to compete in but on balance it was nice, because it was hard to get burnt out (something that happens in the 3+ day events). However, one thing to note is that in total I managed about 3 hours to work on this CTF due to my schedule, but thatâ€™s ok, it was nice to give it a go, and I managed to get 7 flags which Iâ€™m more than happy with. As always, I have curated some (but not all) of my favorite challenges below.

**Currently there arenâ€™t any official write-ups for this event but if that changes I will put the link here.**

## The Emporor

Category: Cryptography

### Description

Ahoye! Here are the crypto newbies!
Today, we are learning the basics of [cryptography](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cryptography)!
Here is an encrypted message for you, try to decipher it. Learning this will help you on the day you will face CrypTopia.

Flag: `B4BY{IJUSTDECODEDACAESARCIPHERWHICHMAKESMEAPROFESSIONALCRYPTOHERO}`

### Write-up

Super simple challenge. We are given a `.txt` file with some text. The text looks rather odd and doesnâ€™t seem to make any sense. It looks as though each letter of each word has been shifted.

```
Ea, kag pqoapqp uf tgt?
Ftqz, tqdq ue ftq rxms:
UVGEFPQOAPQPMOMQEMDOUBTQDITUOTYMWQEYQMBDARQEEUAZMXODKBFATQDA
```

With some experimentation we can figure out that the text has been modified with a Caesar Cipher with a 14 shift.

## Unknown File

Category: Forensics

### Description

Hello young trainees! Today, we are studying [digital forensics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Digital_forensics)! This may be useful if one day you have to face PwnTopia...

Here is a file, you have to find a way to read its content. Good luck!

Flag: `B4BY{h1dD3n_PDF!}`

### Write-up

`strings challenge`

Nothing crazy useful in the output but it is somewhat readable. It doesnâ€™t seem to be packed.

`file challenge`

![](https://res.cloudinary.com/djo6idowf/image/upload/v1749461178/image_ahnlhf.png)

Itâ€™s a PDF file.

![](https://res.cloudinary.com/djo6idowf/image/upload/v1749461183/image_zvszew.png)

A surprisingly easy challenge, but definitely one that could trip someone up if they go down the rabbit hole of trying to find flags in the strings or trying to really break down the file. You just simply go ahead and open it up like a PDF and there is the flag.

## Read The Bytes!

Category: Reverse Engineering

### Description

Look who's there! New students! Fine, this time we will focus on [reverse engineering](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reverse_engineering). This could help you against PwnTopia one day!

I give you now a Python program and its output. Try to understand how it works!

Flag: `B4BY{4_Ch4raC73r_1s_Ju5t_4_nUm83r!}`

### Write-up

We are given a `.py` file that is not intended to run but you can read it and try to figure out what exactly itâ€™s doing.

![](https://res.cloudinary.com/djo6idowf/image/upload/v1749461189/image_qlla3w.png)

So the script actually gives us the output which is handy. They are numbers, which look to be ASCII, so what needs to be done it to find the letters that correspond with the ASCII in the order they are presented in the script to get the flag. Takes a bit of time, but you can just slowly put it all together and you get the flag!

## Tak Tak

Category: OSINT

### Description

Aloha querid@s! ^^

It's finally time to dive into the fascinating world of [OSINT](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Open-source_intelligence),
 that magical word that excites digital detectives and gives regular 
folks the chills. Today, weâ€™ll be starting with the baaasic stuff: just a
 bit of reverse image searching to warm up!

Now, story time: Alice has stumbled into N0PStopia and found herself in a surreal place, lined entirely with chairs. ðŸª‘

Will you be able to figure out where this tunnel is, when it opened, 
and, just for fun, how many chairs are in there? It seemed like it 
stretches into infinity.. x)

The challenge talks about reverse searching so letâ€™s not over complicate and give it a go.

More success with an AI reverse search.

Follow one of the links and it leads to an article about Copenhagen.

B4BY{Design-Museum-Denmark_1890_13} - so far but this is incorrect.

![](https://res.cloudinary.com/djo6idowf/image/upload/v1749461210/image_uixgmu.png)

â€˜Chair tunnelâ€™ - that seems to fit the challenge description.

![](https://res.cloudinary.com/djo6idowf/image/upload/v1749461216/image_hkxcqj.png)

B4BY{Design-Museum-Denmark_June-7th-2024_125} - still not correct. â€˜Designmuseumâ€™ maybe? Does it want Denmark or Copenhagen as the location?

![](https://res.cloudinary.com/djo6idowf/image/upload/v1749461215/image_vynhwj.png)

The information gathered to create the flag:

- Design Museum
- Denmark
- June 7th 2024
- 125 chairs

## Welcome to N0PStopia!

Category: Miscellaneous

### Description

Dear hackers, welcome toÂ **N0PStopia**!

I amÂ **n00psy**, and I live here. I requested your help as the evil lords ofÂ **PwnTopia**,Â **CrypTopia**Â andÂ **WebTopia**Â are trying to break into our peaceful cartoon land!!

To enterÂ **N0PStopia**, please enter the key that I provided to you onÂ [**N0PSctf Discord Server**](https://discord.com/invite/xqvnaGzG6x)

Once the server is joined, accept the rules and look to pinned messages on the general channel.

See you on the other side!

Flag: `N0PS{w3lc0me_T0_n0p5t0p14!!}`

### Write-up

Go on Discord and look in the general chat for the flag. Really easy, but I actually like these challenges because it gives people with no CTF experience or skills a way to get at least one flag - and thatâ€™s important. This flag would actually get a lot harder to find the longer the event went on because it was placed in the `#general` chat which would go on to get spammed.

## Press Me If U Can

Category: Web

### Description

"Stop chasing me!" said the button.

"We can't. It's our job." they answered.

Trapped in WebTopia on a page with no way out, except for the fleeing button. Can you break free?

Flag: `N0PS{W3l1_i7_w4S_Ju5T_F0r_Fun}`

### Write-up

The button moves away as you try to get close to it with the cursor.

![](https://res.cloudinary.com/djo6idowf/image/upload/v1749461219/image_uojbzn.png)

I added an `absolute` position to the HTML client-side but when I click the button nothing happens.

![](https://res.cloudinary.com/djo6idowf/image/upload/v1749461222/image_mt98vp.png)

`disabled=""` is likely blocking the click. So what we can do is enable the button, and then click it with some JavaScript.

`document.querySelector('button[name="submit"]').disabled = false; document.querySelector('button[name="submit"]').click();`

Which then gives us the flag.

## Overall Experience

Fairly enjoyable all around. I obviously didnâ€™t have a tremendous amount of time to actually participate but with the limited time I had did have I did enjoy it. The challenges were at a really good level, and the hints were helpful but not overboard - something that many events get wrong in both regards. The characters that were made for the event to setup the story of the CTF were pretty interesting as well.

8/10 - would have benefited from being able to play the full event. I would rate it higher but they didnâ€™t supply a certificate afterwards which was a disappointing!

## Lessons Learned

- Install ParrotOS because Kali is always crashing which made my limited playtime even more limited.

## Preparation for Next Time

- Plan to participate for longer than 3 hours. Although it was nice to compete at least for a little bit, it wasnâ€™t feasible to get a decent ranking with such a small amount of time.
