If you're reading this, you're probably either mulling over whether to dive into Hack The Box's Dante Pro Lab or you're already knee-deep in it and hunting for some non-spoiler guidance to get unstuck. Whichever camp you're in, I reckon there's something useful here for you. This isn't a walkthrough or a hint drop – just some straightforward advice on tackling the lab, mixed in with my own experiences from grinding through it. I'll cover tips to keep you sane, why its age can be a pain, the headaches I hit along the way, when you might actually be ready for it, how much time it'll eat up, and my final thoughts on the whole thing.

## Tips

One of the biggest pieces of advice I can give for tackling Dante is to document everything. Seriously, keep detailed notes on every step, every machine, and every connection you make, because this lab is sprawling and it's easy to lose track. You'll also want to make good use of scripts and tools to automate where you can, as it'll save you a ton of time and frustration. And don't forget to be mindful of how weak some pivot connections can be – they might drop or behave oddly, so adapt your network commands accordingly to keep things stable.

## Time Investment

Everyone's experience with Dante is going to be different – it might take you just a week if everything clicks, or it could stretch to four weeks, or even drag on for three months depending on your schedule and how things go. I'd strongly recommend steering clear of the Hack The Box Discord or forums while you're working on it, because you'll inevitably see posts from people claiming you should be able to knock it out in a week. Sure, there are probably some wizards out there who pull that off, but it's not a realistic expectation for most folks.

In my view, you should plan on sinking at least 80 hours into Dante overall. How you divvy that up is totally up to you – whether it's intense bursts or spread out over time – but 80 feels like a pretty accurate ballpark. A good chunk of those hours will end up being wasted on dealing with connectivity issues, so brace yourself for that. Have fun.

## Dante's Age

Dante has been around for a while, and it shows in some ways. The "proper" way to approach certain parts can feel cumbersome now, especially since there are newer exploits out there that make getting flags a bit easier if you know where to look. You'll run into some weird interactions and workarounds because the tools that were originally intended for some boxes aren't maintained anymore, forcing you to find alternatives. On top of that, you might hit bugs in the environment itself. From my experience, support won't go beyond just resetting the lab – they won't actually troubleshoot or fix underlying issues. This is something I've seen in the Academy courses too; you're basically on your own. Of course, try your best and experiment with different methods, but don't get caught in the trap of thinking "I just need to try harder" if something's not working – sometimes it's the lab's fault, and beating your head against the wall isn't great for learning.

## Issues

The boxes in Dante crashed a lot during my run, and I ended up contacting support multiple times to get the lab reset. It was usually a quick 10-minute fix, but the downside is that any files you'd uploaded or changes you'd made get wiped out, so you have to keep backups and re-upload everything to get back to where you were. After a while, this repetition gets really tiresome. As I mentioned a bit earlier, the lab doesn't seem well-maintained overall – or at least it feels that way. Support tends to brush off any weird quirks or bugs you report. At this point, Dante is about 5 years old and probably needs a full rebuild and modernization. Even after I finished, I checked the official write-up to see the intended paths, and when I tried following them for some later stages, they just didn't work as described.

## When Are You Ready?

Dante is tagged as beginner-level, which I think is totally disingenuous. There's nothing beginner-friendly about a lab with this many machines – the exploits might be straightforward, but navigating the whole environment, documenting properly, and figuring out your next moves isn't entry-level at all. This is a pattern I've noticed with a lot of Hack The Box labs and machines; they're labeled based on the exploits alone, ignoring the bigger context. If you've gotten through about 50% of the CPTS course, you're probably ready to at least give Dante a shot. I'd recommend mixing it in with CPTS – when you get burned out on Academy labs, spend a couple of days on Dante to switch things up and stay fresh, then jump back. If you can handle Easy machines on Hack The Box without any hints, you're definitely prepared; even if you occasionally need a nudge, it's still worth dipping into Dante. The real issue with Pro Labs is the higher subscription cost, so most people grab a month, blast through, and cancel. To play it safe in that scenario, finish the CPTS course first, then tackle Dante right after as exam practice.

## Overall Thoughts

Dante is a really solid challenge that demands excellent notetaking and some creative, out-of-the-box thinking. You'll learn a ton from it, which is ultimately the most important takeaway. Looking back, though, I wouldn't pick this as my first Pro Lab – if I had to do it over, I'd probably skip it in favor of the mini labs first, then move on to the other major ones, purely because of Dante's age and the headaches I dealt with.
