If you're reading this, you're probably either mulling over whether to dive into Hack The Box's Dante Pro Lab or you're already knee-deep in it and hunting for some non-spoiler guidance to get unstuck. Whichever camp you're in, I reckon there's something useful here for you. This isn't a walkthrough or a hint drop – just some straightforward advice on tackling the lab, mixed in with my own experiences from grinding through it. I'll cover tips to keep you sane, why its age can be a pain, the headaches I hit along the way, when you might actually be ready for it, how much time it'll eat up, and my final thoughts on the whole thing.

## Tips

One of the biggest pieces of advice I can give for tackling Dante is to document everything. Seriously, keep detailed notes on every step, every machine, and every connection you make, because this lab is sprawling and it's easy to lose track. You'll also want to make good use of scripts and tools to automate where you can, as it'll save you a ton of time and frustration. And don't forget to be mindful of how weak some pivot connections can be – they might drop or behave oddly, so adapt your network commands accordingly to keep things stable.

## Time Investment

Everyone's experience with Dante is going to be different – it might take you just a week if everything clicks, or it could stretch to four weeks, or even drag on for three months depending on your schedule and how things go. I'd strongly recommend steering clear of the Hack The Box Discord or forums while you're working on it, because you'll inevitably see posts from people claiming you should be able to knock it out in a week. Sure, there are probably some wizards out there who pull that off, but it's not a realistic expectation for most folks.

In my view, you should plan on sinking at least 80 hours into Dante overall. How you divvy that up is totally up to you – whether it's intense bursts or spread out over time – but 80 feels like a pretty accurate ballpark. A good chunk of those hours will end up being wasted on dealing with connectivity issues, so brace yourself for that. Have fun.

## Issues

Dante has been around for a while, and it really shows in the overall experience. The boxes crashed a lot during my run, and I ended up contacting support multiple times for lab resets. Usually, a reset fixed things in about ten minutes, but the downside is that any files you’d uploaded or changes you’d made get wiped out, so you have to keep backups and re-upload everything just to get back to where you were. After a while, this repetition gets seriously tiresome.

The lab just doesn’t feel well-maintained anymore. You’ll run into weird bugs and quirks, and support won’t do much beyond resetting the lab. If you report something odd, they tend to brush it off. On top of that, many of the tools and techniques the original boxes were designed for are now outdated or unmaintained, so you might find yourself forced to improvise or hunt down alternatives. Sometimes the “proper” way to do things feels clunky compared to newer exploits, and parts of the lab just don’t work the way the official write-ups describe.

It’s hard to know if you’re stuck because you’re missing something, or if the lab itself is just broken on that day. This can really drain your motivation and make you doubt yourself. My advice: don’t fall into the trap of thinking you just need to grind harder when things aren’t working. Sometimes, it’s absolutely the lab’s fault and bashing your head against the wall isn’t good for learning. At this point, Dante is about five years old and could really use a full rebuild or some modernization.

## When Are You Ready?

Dante is tagged as beginner-level, which I think is totally disingenuous. There's nothing beginner-friendly about a lab with this many machines – the exploits might be straightforward, but navigating the whole environment, documenting properly, and figuring out your next moves isn't entry-level at all. This is a pattern I've noticed with a lot of Hack The Box labs and machines; they're labeled based on the exploits alone, ignoring the bigger context. If you've gotten through about 50% of the CPTS course, you're probably ready to at least give Dante a shot. I'd recommend mixing it in with CPTS – when you get burned out on Academy labs, spend a couple of days on Dante to switch things up and stay fresh, then jump back. If you can handle Easy machines on Hack The Box without any hints, you're definitely prepared; even if you occasionally need a nudge, it's still worth dipping into Dante. The real issue with Pro Labs is the higher subscription cost, so most people grab a month, blast through, and cancel. To play it safe in that scenario, finish the CPTS course first, then tackle Dante right after as exam practice.

## Overall Thoughts

Dante is a really solid challenge that demands excellent notetaking and some creative, out-of-the-box thinking. You'll learn a ton from it, which is ultimately the most important takeaway. Looking back, though, I wouldn't pick this as my first Pro Lab – if I had to do it over, I'd probably skip it in favor of the mini labs first, then move on to the other major ones, purely because of Dante's age and the headaches I dealt with.
