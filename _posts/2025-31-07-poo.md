If you’re looking for honest, non-spoiler thoughts on Hack The Box’s P.O.O Pro Lab, you’re in the right place. After finishing Dante, I wanted something lighter. P.O.O looked like the perfect “breather.” Two machines, five flags, how difficult could it be? As it turns out, it’s more challenging and frustrating than the numbers or the “beginner” label suggest. Here’s my experience and some advice that might help you decide if you want to take it on.

## Tips

First and foremost, keep detailed notes just like you would with Dante. You won't get through P.O.O in a single sitting, so you’ll need to remember what you tried and where you left off. Every credential, every command, and every little find should go into your notes because you’ll almost certainly need to backtrack.

One nice thing: the lab is tiny compared to Dante. There’s no need to worry about setting up proxies or dealing with complex pivots. You can focus on the machines themselves without juggling network headaches. That said, the difficulty comes from other angles, so stay alert.

## Time Investment

At a glance, P.O.O looks like a quick win. In reality, it will take at least a few days. There are basically no hints, so you have to be comfortable figuring things out with zero hand-holding. Dante occasionally gives you nudges when you get stuck, but P.O.O does not. If you’re someone who likes a few breadcrumbs now and then, be prepared for some frustration.

The good news is that you do not have to deal with long setup times every time you want to work on the lab. You can log in, get started right away, and make progress in shorter sessions. I found that I could sit down for an hour at a time and actually get somewhere, which is a big improvement over Dante’s long, draining sessions.

## Issues

P.O.O has its fair share of bugs, just like Dante. Some are small, and some are big enough to make you question if you’re doing something wrong or if the lab is just broken. This feeling of not knowing whether you’re stuck because of a lab problem or your own mistake can really wear you down.

It feels like these labs are not getting much ongoing maintenance. I really think Hack The Box could improve the experience if their staff ran through their own walkthroughs every few months to spot any outdated steps or broken components. As things stand, you are expected to figure things out on your own, and support will usually only help with resets.

## When Are You Ready?

It’s tricky to say who is actually ready for this lab. P.O.O is labeled as beginner-friendly, but that is honestly not accurate. The lab is short, but the actual difficulty can be much higher than you’d expect. You will find yourself second-guessing everything and wondering if you are missing something obvious.

I recommend doing Dante before you try P.O.O. Even though Dante is bigger, the structure is more predictable. P.O.O is shorter but less intuitive and much less forgiving. If you can get through Dante, then you might be ready for P.O.O, but don't expect it to be an easier ride just because it is smaller.

## Overall Thoughts
To be honest, I did not enjoy P.O.O. The small scope is nice, but the bugs, lack of guidance, and confusing difficulty made the whole thing a slog. I do not think it is a good first Pro Lab, and the “beginner” tag is misleading. After finishing it, I am honestly dreading the intermediate and advanced labs if this is what counts as beginner.

In the end, you will learn something from P.O.O, even if it’s just how to stay patient when the environment seems to be working against you. If you are just starting out with Pro Labs, I would suggest Dante or the mini labs first. Save P.O.O for later, and go in with patience and low expectations for a smooth experience.
